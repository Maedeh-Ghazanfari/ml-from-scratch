!!! It was one of the hardest from scratch for me!

# 🧠 Decision Tree (Gini Impurity) from Scratch

This project implements the **first step** of building a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch in Python, focusing on selecting the best feature and threshold using **Gini Impurity**.

## 📌 Objective

To understand and implement the core mechanism behind decision trees, particularly how the **best feature and threshold** for splitting data are chosen using **Gini impurity** as the splitting criterion.

## 🧮 What This Project Does

- Calculates **midpoints** (thresholds) for continuous features.
- Computes **Gini impurity** for left and right splits at each threshold.
- Calculates **weighted Gini** across all features.
- Identifies the **best feature and threshold** for the first split (root node of a decision tree).

## 📊 Dataset

You can use any labeled classification dataset with numerical features and a categorical target (I used the wine quality dataset from Kaggle.).

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. For each feature:
   - Generate possible thresholds.
   - Split the data at each threshold.
   - Compute Gini impurity for each split.
2. Calculate **weighted Gini** across all features.
3. Choose the feature + threshold with the **lowest Gini** as the first node.

> ⚠️ Full tree construction (recursion, stopping conditions, etc.) is **not** implemented — this project focuses on understanding and computing the **first split** accurately.

## 📚 What I Learned

- The mathematical concept and intuition behind Gini impurity.
- How decision trees choose the best split.
- How to manipulate and analyze data using `pandas`.
- The complexity involved in building models from scratch.

## 🧠 Why I Stopped Here

This project was challenging and rewarding. After reaching the point of identifying the first split, I decided to pause. Building a full recursive decision tree requires structural design and recursion that I found overwhelming at this stage — and that’s okay. I now deeply understand how trees begin, and I plan to build upon this foundation in the future.

## 🔍 Next Steps (if continued)

- Implement recursion to split nodes until the stopping criteria.
- Add stopping conditions (e.g., max depth, min samples, pure node).
- Visualize the decision tree.
- Compare results with `scikit-learn`'s implementation.
