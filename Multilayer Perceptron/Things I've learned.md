## Can I initialize weights and biases with any random number at the beginning?

Just watch out for symmetry problems! If all weights in a layer are initialized to the same value (e.g., zero), every neuron in that layer will produce identical outputs and receive identical gradients during training.

This causes them to update in the same way, making neurons redundant and preventing the network from learning diverse features.

To avoid this, weights are initialized with small random values to break symmetry, allowing neurons to learn different patterns.
