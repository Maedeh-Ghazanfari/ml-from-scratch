# Perceptron from Scratch

This notebook implements the Perceptron algorithm from scratch using NumPy and pandas.

## Features:
- Binary classification
- Error logging per epoch
- Early stopping when 100% accuracy is reached

## How to Run:
Open the `Perceptron.ipynb` notebook and run all cells.

## Future Plans (maybe):
- Compare with scikit-learn's implementation
