My personal implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch for learning.

# Machine Learning From Scratch üöÄ

This repository contains my implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using **NumPy** ‚Äî without using ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

This project aims to deepen my understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood by building them from the ground up.
